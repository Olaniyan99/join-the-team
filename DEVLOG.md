Although, i had very limited time wokring on this project due to the fact i am on vacation out of the country with limited internet access,
i did enjoy this project very much and learned alot during the process. i loved working with Node js and if given the opportunity, i would 
love to learn more with CLARK development team.

P.S: I did find the backend of this project challenging, this showed me my weak points and what i need to work on more. Thank you for the opportunity.
